## Github Repo Structure
This repo is a [multi-root workspace](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces) configured in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).  To open the workspace in VS Code, open the `blockchain.code-workspace` file.  Each root is a project folder containing a project submission to the Blockchain Developer Nanodegree.  To make it easy to maintain and debug my code, I've containerized each project and configured VS Code [tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/tasks) and [launch](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging#_launch-configurations) configurations.

### Launching Projects
To run the code for any given project, you can simply navigate to the Run dialog (View > Run), select the project to run and then click run.  This will build the project's docker image and kick-off the application code as shown in the screenshots below.  Tasks are also available via the VS Code [command palette](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette).

1. Select project to launch
